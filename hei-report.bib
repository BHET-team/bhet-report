Methods                                  We analysed the baseline information from a longitudinal study in southwestern China. Women's brachial and central blood pressure and pulse pressure, carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity and augmentation index, and their 48-hour personal exposures to fine particulate matter (PM                  2.5                  ) and black carbon were measured in summer and winter. We evaluated the associations between exposure to air pollution and haemodynamic parameters using mixed-effects regression models adjusted for known cardiovascular risk factors.                                                            Results                                  Women's (n=205, ages 27--86 years) exposures to PM                  2.5                  and black carbon ranged from 14 {\textmu}g/m                  3                  to 1405\,{\textmu}g/m                  3                  and 0.1--121.8\,{\textmu}g/m                  3                  , respectively. Among women aged {$\geq$}50 years, increased PM                  2.5                  exposure was associated with higher systolic (brachial: 3.5\,mm Hg (P=0.05); central: 4.4\,mm Hg (P=0.005)) and diastolic blood pressure (central: 1.3\,mm Hg (P=0.10)), higher pulse pressure (peripheral: 2.5\,mm Hg (P=0.05); central: 2.9\,mm Hg (P=0.008)) and lower peripheral--central pulse pressure amplification (-0.007 (P=0.04)). Among younger women, the associations were inconsistent in the direction of effect and not statistically significant. Increased PM                  2.5                  exposure was associated with no difference in pulse wave velocity and modestly higher augmentation index though the CI included zero (1.1\%; 95\%\,CI -0.2\% to 2.4\%). Similar associations were found for black carbon exposure.                                                            Conclusions                Exposure to household air pollution was associated with higher blood pressure and central haemodynamics in older Chinese women, with no associations observed with pulse wave velocity.},

  abstract = {Mediation analysis offers an essential and rapidly expanding tool in environmental health studies to investigate the contribution of environmental factors towards observed associations between risk factors and health outcomes. When evaluating environmental factors, there may be particular interest in quantifying the impact of exposure to environmental mixtures on human health. In this context, evaluating the joint effect of multiple chemicals or pollutants, rather than individual examination, allows accurate identification of risk factors, assessment of interactions, and ultimately development of more targeted public health interventions. While mediation analysis has been extended to incorporate several methodological complexities specific to environmental factors, little attention has been given to integrating the analysis of environmental mixtures. The aim of this review is to present some of the available methods for environmental mixtures, and discuss how these methods can be integrated within a mediation analysis framework. By incorporating these methods into a mediation framework, investigators will be able to evaluate the contribution of environmental mixtures as mediators of exposure-outcome associations, based on methodologies that are currently available. While standard regression-based methods for multiple mediators can be used, these can easily become unstable as the number of mixture components increases. Summary and classification methods, or hierarchical modeling, can reduce the number of mediators by creating scores or possibly uncorrelated subgroups. This approach allows retrieving indirect effects due to the mixture or to a specific subgroup, but makes identification of component-specific effects and interactions complicated. Finally, one can use various approaches for analyzing mixtures in a two-stage fashion, selecting relevant mediators to be included in the final model. We focused this review on techniques that have been presented to the environmental health community and that can be conducted with major statistical software. We encourage researchers to move beyond the evaluation of one environmental factor at a time to the assessment of the joint effects of environmental mixtures when a mediation model is of interest. Available methods target different aspects related to environmental mixtures and the choice of the suitable approach will depend on data structures and the research question of interest.},

Air pollution is one crucial example. Established evidence from other respiratory viruses and emerging evidence for COVID-19 specifically indicates that air pollution alters respiratory defense mechanisms leading to worsened infection severity. Air pollution also contributes to comorbidities that are known to worsen outcomes among those infected with COVID-19, and air pollution may also enhance infection transmission due to its impact on more frequent coughing. Yet despite the massive disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic, there are reasons for optimism: broad societal lockdowns have shown us a glimpse of what a future with strong air pollution measures could yield. Thus, the urgency to combat air pollution is not diminished, but instead heightened in the context of the pandemic.},

This chapter reviews a number of important, recent developments related to difference-in-differences. First, this chapter reviews recent work pointing out limitations of two-way fixed-effects regressions (these are panel data regressions that have been the dominant approach to implementing difference-in-differences identification strategies) that arise in empirically relevant settings where there are more than two time periods, variation in treatment timing across units, and treatment effect heterogeneity. Second, this chapter reviews recently proposed alternative approaches that are able to circumvent these issues without being substantially more complicated to implement. Third, this chapter covers a number of extensions to these results, paying particular attention to (i) parallel trends assumptions that hold only after conditioning on observed covariates and (ii) strategies to partially identify causal effect parameters in difference-in-differences applications in cases where the parallel trends assumption may be violated.},

We show that a family of causal effect parameters are identified in staggered DiD setups, even if differences in observed characteristics create non-parallel outcome dynamics between groups. Our identification results allow one to use outcome regression, inverse probability weighting, or doubly-robust estimands. We also propose different aggregation schemes that can be used to highlight treatment effect heterogeneity across different dimensions as well as to summarize the overall effect of participating in the treatment. We establish the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators and prove the validity of a computationally convenient bootstrap procedure to conduct asymptotically valid simultaneous (instead of pointwise) inference. Finally, we illustrate the relevance of our proposed tools by analyzing the effect of the minimum wage on teen employment from 2001--2007. Open-source software is available for implementing the proposed methods.},

  abstract = {Central blood pressure (BP) can be estimated noninvasively by analyzing brachial artery waveforms. In this study, our aim was to assess the validity of a brachial cuff-based (suprasystolic) technique for estimating central BP (CBPestimated) by comparison with invasive aortic BP (CBPinvasive).Eighty-four simultaneous CBPestimated (Pulsecor R7.0) and CBPinvasive measures were recorded in 47 patients (aged 63{\textpm}10 years, 62\% male) undergoing coronary angiography. Measures were captured at baseline and acutely following intravenous glyceryl trinitrate (GTN; 100--200 {$\mu$}g). Mean CBPinvasive systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) were compared with CBPestimated SBP and DBP calibrated with brachial SBP and DBP recorded from the Pulsecor device. To test validity of the central BP algorithm, measures of CBPestimated SBP were also compared with CBPinvasive SBP following recalibration with invasive mean arterial pressure (MAP) and DBP.At baseline, mean difference {\textpm} standard deviation between CBPestimated SBP and CBPinvasive SBP was -7{\textpm}9mm Hg (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.86; P \&lt; 0.001) with similar underestimation post-GTN (-6{\textpm}9mm Hg; ICC = 0.90; P \&lt; 0.001). Recalibration of CBPestimated SBP with invasive MAP and DBP resulted in closer mean difference to CBPinvasive SBP (-2{\textpm}7mm Hg; ICC = 0.95; P \&lt; 0.001) at baseline but not post-GTN (-6{\textpm}7mm Hg; ICC = 0.95; P \&lt; 0.001).The Pulsecor algorithm to derive central BP has acceptable validity when calibrated with invasive pressures. However, accuracy is compromised when noninvasive brachial cuff BP calibration is used.},

  abstract = {During the 1980s the Republic of Ireland experienced repeated severe pollution episodes. Domestic coal burning was a major source of this pollution. In 1990 the Irish government introduced a ban on the marketing, sale, and distribution of coal in Dublin. The ban was extended to Cork in 1995 and to 10 other communities in 1998 and 2000. We previously reported decreases in particulate black smoke (BS*) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) concentrations, measured as total gaseous acidity, in Dublin after the 1990 coal ban (Clancy et al. 2002). In the current study we explored and compared the effectiveness of the sequential 1990, 1995, and 1998 bans in reducing community air pollution and in improving public health. We compiled records of daily BS, total gaseous acidity (SO2), and counts of cause-specific deaths from 1981 to 2004 for Dublin County Borough (1990 ban), county Cork (1995 ban), and counties Limerick, Louth, Wexford, and Wicklow (1998 ban). We also compiled daily counts of hospital admissions for cardiovascular, respiratory, and digestive diagnoses for Cork County Borough (1991 to 2004) and counties Limerick, Louth, Wexford, and Wicklow (1993 to 2004). We compared pre-ban and post-ban BS and SO2 concentrations for each city. Using interrupted time-series methods, we estimated the change in cause-specific, directly standardized mortality rates in each city or county after the corresponding local coal ban. We regressed weekly age- and sex-standardized mortality rates against an indicator of the post- versus pre-ban period, adjusting for influenza epidemics, weekly mean temperature, and a season smooth of the standardized mortality rates in Coastal counties presumably not affected by the bans. We compared these results with similar analyses in Midlands counties also presumably unaffected by the bans. We also estimated the change in cause-specific, directly standardized, weekly hospital admissions rates normalized for underreporting in each city or county after the 1995 and 1998 bans, adjusting for influenza epidemics, weekly mean temperature, and local admissions for digestive diagnoses. Mean BS concentrations fell in all affected population centers post-ban compared with the pre-ban period, with decreases ranging from 4 to 35 microg/m3 (corresponding to reductions of 45\% to 70\%, respectively), but we observed no clear pattern in SO2 measured as total gaseous acidity associated with the bans. In comparisons with the pre-ban periods, no significant reduction was found in total death rates associated with the 1990 (1\% reduction), 1995 (4\% reduction), or 1998 (0\% reduction) bans, nor for cardiovascular mortality (0\%, 4\%, and 1\% reductions for the 1990, 1995, and 1998 bans, respectively). Respiratory mortality was reduced in association with the bans (17\%, 9\%, and 3\%, respectively). We found a 4\% decrease in hospital admissions for cardiovascular disease associated with the 1995 ban and a 3\% decrease with the 1998 ban. Admissions for respiratory disease were not consistently lower after the bans; admissions for pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and asthma were reduced. However, underreporting of hospital admissions data and lack of control and comparison series tempered our confidence in these results. The successive coal bans resulted in immediate and sustained decreases in particulate concentrations in each city or town; with the largest decreases in winter and during the heating season. The bans were associated with reductions in respiratory mortality but no detectable improvement in cardiovascular mortality. The changes in hospital admissions for respiratory and cardiovascular disease were supportive of these findings but cannot be considered confirming. Detecting changes in public health indicators associated even with clear improvements in air quality, as in this case, remains difficult when there are simultaneous secular improvements in the same health indicators.},

  abstract = {Several studies have investigated the short-term effects of ambient air pollutants in the development of high blood pressure and hypertension. However, little information exists regarding the health effects of long-term exposure. To investigate the association between residential long-term exposure to air pollution and blood pressure and hypertension, we studied 24 845 Chinese adults in 11 districts of 3 northeastern cities from 2009 to 2010. Three-year average concentration of particles with an aerodynamic diameter {$\leq$}10 {\textmu}m (PM               10               ), sulfur dioxide (SO               2               ), nitrogen dioxides (NO               2               ), and ozone (O               3               ) were calculated from monitoring stations in the 11 districts. We used generalized additive models and 2-level logistic regressions models to examine the health effects. The results showed that the odds ratio for hypertension increased by 1.12 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.08--1.16) per 19 {$\mu$}g/m               3               increase in PM               10               , 1.11 (95\% CI, 1.04--1.18) per 20 {$\mu$}g/m               3               increase in SO               2               , and 1.13 (95\% CI, 1.06--1.20) per 22 {$\mu$}g/m               3               increase in O               3               . The estimated increases in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure were 0.87 mm Hg (95\% CI, 0.48--1.27) and 0.32 mm Hg (95\% CI, 0.08--0.56) per 19 {$\mu$}g/m               3               interquartile increase in PM               10               , 0.80 mm Hg (95\% CI, 0.46--1.14) and 0.31 mm Hg (95\% CI, 0.10--0.51) per 20 {$\mu$}g/m               3               interquartile increase in SO               2               , and 0.73 mm Hg (95\% CI, 0.35--1.11) and 0.37 mm Hg (95\% CI, 0.14--0.61) per 22 {$\mu$}g/m               3               interquartile increase in O               3               . These associations were only statistically significant in men. In conclusion, long-term exposure to PM               10               , SO               2               , and O               3               was associated with increased arterial blood pressure and hypertension in the study population.},

The authors urge clinicians to evaluate each patient on maintenance antipsychotic therapy in terms of feasibility of drug withdrawal and offer practical guidelines for withdrawal and subsequent management.},

  abstract = {Background:~           Two-way fixed effects methods have been used to estimate effects of policies adopted in different places over time, but they can provide misleading results when effects are heterogeneous or dynamic, and alternate methods have been proposed.           Methods:~           We compared methods for estimating the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) under staggered adoption of policies, including two-way fixed effects, group-time ATT, cohort ATT, and target-trial approaches. We applied each method to assess the impact of Medicaid expansion on preterm birth using the National Center for Health Statistics' birth records. We compared each estimator's performance in a simulation parameterized to mimic the empirical example. We generated constant, heterogeneous, and dynamic effects and calculated bias, mean squared error, and confidence interval coverage of each estimator across 1000 iterations.           Results:~           Two-way fixed effects estimated that Medicaid expansion increased the risk of preterm birth (risk difference [RD], 0.12; 95\% CI = 0.02, 0.22), while the group-time ATT, cohort ATT, and target-trial approaches estimated protective or null effects (group-time RD, -0.16; 95\% CI = -0.58, 0.26; cohort RD, -0.02; 95\% CI = -0.46, 0.41; target trial RD, -0.16; 95\% CI = -0.59, 0.26). In simulations, two-way fixed effects performed well when treatment effects were constant and less well under heterogeneous and dynamic effects.           Conclusions:~           We demonstrated why new approaches perform better than two-way fixed effects when treatment effects are heterogeneous or dynamic under a staggered policy adoption design, and created simulation and analysis code to promote understanding and wider use of these methods in the epidemiologic literature.},

This paper shows that the two-way fixed effects estimator equals a weighted average of all possible two-group/two-period DD estimators in the data. A causal interpretation of two-way fixed effects DD estimates requires both a parallel trends assumption and treatment effects that are constant over time. I show how to decompose the difference between two specifications, and provide a new analysis of models that include time-varying controls.},

Methods               Using mixed-effects regression models, we investigated the associations of household air pollution with blood pressure (BP) and vascular function in 753 adults (ages 40--79 years) from 3 diverse provinces in China. We conducted repeated measures of participants' household fuel use, personal exposure to fine particulate air pollution (PM2.5), BP, brachial--femoral pulse wave velocity (bfPWV), and augmentation index. Ultrasound images of the carotid arteries were obtained to assess intima--media thickness (CIMT) and plaques. Covariate information on sociodemographics, health behaviors, 24-h urinary sodium, and blood lipids was also obtained.                                         Results               Average estimated yearly personal exposure to PM2.5 was 97.5 {\textmu}g/m3 (SD: 79.2; range: 3.5--1241), and 65\% of participants cooked with solid fuel. In multivariable models, current solid fuel use was associated with higher systolic (2.4 mm Hg, 95\% CI: -0.4, 4.9) and diastolic BP (1.4 mm Hg, 95\% CI: -0.1, 3.0) and greater total area of plaques (1.7 mm2, 95\% CI: -6.5, 9.8) compared with exclusive use of electricity or gas stoves. A 1 - ln({\textmu}g/m3) increase in PM2.5 exposure was associated with higher systolic (1.5 mm Hg, 95\% CI: 0.2, 2.7) and diastolic BP (1.0 mm Hg, 95\% CI: 0.4, 1.7) and with greater CIMT (0.02 mm, 95\% CI: 0.00, 0.04) and total area of plaques (4.7 mm2, 95\% CI: -2.0, 11.5). We did not find associations with arterial stiffness, except for a lower bfPWV (-1.5 m/s, 95\% CI: -3.0, -0.0) among users of solid fuel heaters.                                         Conclusions               These findings add to limited evidence that household air pollution is associated with higher BP and with greater CIMT and total plaque area.},

  abstract = {The Chinese government implemented a national household energy transition program that replaced residential coal heating stoves with electricity-powered heat pumps for space heating in northern China. As part of a baseline assessment of the program, this study investigated variability in personal air pollution exposures within villages and between villages and evaluated exposure patterns by sociodemographic factors. We randomly recruited 446 participants in 50 villages in four districts in rural Beijing and measured 24 h personal exposures to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and black carbon (BC). The geometric mean personal exposure to PM2.5 and BC was 72 and 2.5 {$\mu$}g/m3, respectively. The variability in PM2.5 and BC exposures was greater within villages than between villages. Study participants who used traditional stoves as their dominant source of space heating were exposed to the highest levels of PM2.5 and BC. Wealthier households tended to burn more coal for space heating, whereas less wealthy households used more biomass. PM2.5 and BC exposures were almost uniformly distributed by socioeconomic status. Future work that combines these results with PM2.5 chemical composition analysis will shed light on whether air pollution source contributors (e.g., industrial, traffic, and household solid fuel burning) follow similar distributions.},

  abstract = {The coronavirus (COVID-19) lockdown in China is thought to have reduced air pollution emissions due to reduced human mobility and economic activities. Few studies have assessed the impacts of COVID-19 on community and indoor air quality in environments with diverse socioeconomic and household energy use patterns. The main goal of this study was to evaluate whether indoor and community air pollution differed before, during, and after the COVID-19 lockdown in homes with different energy use patterns. Using calibrated real-time PM2.5 sensors, we measured indoor and community air quality in 147 homes from 30 villages in Beijing over 4 months including periods before, during, and after the COVID-19 lockdown. Community pollution was higher during the lockdown (61 {\textpm} 47 {$\mu$}g/m3) compared with before (45 {\textpm} 35 {$\mu$}g/m3, p {$<$} 0.001) and after (47 {\textpm} 37 {$\mu$}g/m3, p {$<$} 0.001) the lockdown. However, we did not observe significantly increased indoor PM2.5 during the COVID-19 lockdown. Indoor-generated PM2.5 in homes using clean energy for heating without smokers was the lowest compared with those using solid fuel with/without smokers, implying air pollutant emissions are reduced in homes using clean energy. Indoor air quality may not have been impacted by the COVID-19 lockdown in rural settings in China and appeared to be more impacted by the household energy choice and indoor smoking than the COVID-19 lockdown. As clean energy transitions occurred in rural households in northern China, our work highlights the importance of understanding multiple possible indoor sources to interpret the impacts of interventions, intended or otherwise.},

The aim of this study was to describe the association between indoor temperature and physical performance in older adults. Eighty-one older adults (84\% women, mean age 80.9 years, standard deviation 6.53) were visited every four weeks from May to October 2015 and additionally during two heat waves in July and August 2015. Indoor temperature, habitual gait speed, chair-rise performance and balance were assessed. Baseline assessment of gait speed was used to create two subgroups (lower versus higher gait speed) based on frailty criteria. The strongest effect of increasing temperature on habitual gait speed was observed in the subgroup of adults with higher gait speed (-0.087 m/s per increase of 10 \,{$^\circ$}C; 95\% confidence interval (CI): -0.136; -0.038). The strongest effects on timed chair-rise and balance performance were observed in the subgroup of adults with lower gait speed (2.03 s per increase of 10 \,{$^\circ$}C (95\% CI: 0.79; 3.28) and -3.92 s per increase of 10 \,{$^\circ$}C (95\% CI: -7.31; -0.52), respectively). Comparing results of physical performance in absentia of a heat wave and during a heat wave, habitual gait speed was negatively affected by heat in the total group and subgroup of adults with higher gait speed, chair-rise performance was negatively affected in all groups and balance was not affected. The study provides arguments for exercise interventions in general for older adults, because a better physical fitness might alleviate impediments of physical capacity and might provide resources for adequate adaptation in older adults during heat stress.},

Methods of non-invasively estimating this pressure would therefore be helpful in clinical practice. To achieve this goal, a physics-based model is derived to correlate the arterial pressure under a suprasystolic upper-arm cuff to the aortic pressure. The model assumptions are particularly applicable to the measurement method and result in a time--domain relation with two parameters, namely, the wave propagation transit time and the reflection coefficient at the cuff. Central pressures estimated by the model were derived from completely automatic, non-invasive measurement of brachial blood pressure and suprasystolic waveform and were compared to simultaneous invasive catheter measurements in 16 subjects. Systolic blood pressure agreement, mean (standard deviation) of difference was -1 (7)mmHg. Diastolic blood pressure agreement was 4 (4)mmHg. Correlation between estimated and actual central waveforms was greater than 90\%. Individualization of model parameters did not significantly improve systolic and diastolic pressure agreement, but increased waveform correlation. Further research is necessary to confirm that more accurate brachial pressure measurement improves central pressure estimation.},

Each dwelling was assessed for temperature, relative humidity, air pollution and biological pollution, as well as blood pressure parameters related to the health of the elderly. The results showed that the temperature in urban dwellings was higher and more stable than that in rural dwellings, due to the difference in heating devices. Indoor carbon dioxide (CO               2               ) concentrations in some dwellings exceeded the limit. Indoor formaldehyde and volatile organic compounds (VOC) were lower than the limit values, while urban dwellings had more formaldehyde and total volatile organic compounds (TVOC) pollution than rural dwellings. For rural houses, indoor fuel combustion resulted in higher concentrations of particulate matter below 2.5 microns (PM               2.5               ) and higher concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO). The biological pollution in rural areas was generally higher than in urban areas. The blood pressure of the elderly in rural areas was higher than that in urban areas, and blood pressure was found to be negatively correlated with room temperature and positively correlated with relative humidity. These results can provide an indicator for the improvement of housing environmental quality for older people in China.},

The campaign will help accelerate China's energy transition and reduce PM               2.5               emission and exposure. The expected exposure reduction is largely due to improved indoor air quality, resulting in greater benefits to women.                        ,                             In addition to many recent actions taken to reduce emissions from energy production, industry, and transportation, a new campaign substituting residential solid fuels with electricity or natural gas has been launched in Beijing, Tianjin, and 26 other municipalities in northern China, aiming at solving severe ambient air pollution in the region. Quantitative analysis shows that the campaign can accelerate residential energy transition significantly, and if the planned target can be achieved, more than 60\% of households are projected to remove solid fuels by 2021, compared with fewer than 20\% without the campaign. Emissions of major air pollutants will be reduced substantially. With 60\% substitution realized, emission of primary PM               2.5               and contribution to ambient PM               2.5               concentration in 2021 are projected to be 30\% and 41\% of those without the campaign. With 60\% substitution, average indoor PM               2.5               concentrations in living rooms in winter are projected to be reduced from 209 (190 to 230) {$\mu$}g/m               3               to 125 (99 to 150) {$\mu$}g/m               3               . The population-weighted PM               2.5               concentrations can be reduced from 140 {$\mu$}g/m               3               in 2014 to 78 {$\mu$}g/m               3               or 61 {$\mu$}g/m               3               in 2021 given that 60\% or 100\% substitution can be accomplished. Although the original focus of the campaign was to address ambient air quality, exposure reduction comes more from improved indoor air quality because {$\sim$}90\% of daily exposure of the rural population is attributable to indoor air pollution.

I use a simulation study to compare the bias and standard error of inverse probability weighting estimators from the TVT framework, a DiD framework, and hybrid approaches that combine ideas from both frameworks. I simulated longitudinal data with treatment effect heterogeneity over multiple time points using linear and logistic models. Simulation settings looked at both time-invariant confounders and time-varying confounders affected by prior treatment. Estimators that combined ideas from both frameworks had lower bias than standard TVT and DiD estimators when assumptions were unmet. The TVT framework provides estimation tools that can complement DiD tools in a wide range of applied settings. It also provides alternate estimands for consideration in policy settings.},

  abstract = {Recent methodological innovation is giving rise to an increasing number of applied papers in medical and epidemiological journals in which natural direct and indirect effects are estimated. However, there is a longstanding debate on whether such effects are relevant targets of inference in population health. In light of the repeated calls for a more pragmatic and consequential epidemiology, we review three issues often raised in this debate: (i) the use of composite cross-world counterfactuals and the need for cross-world independence assumptions; (ii) interventional vs non-interventional identifiability; and (iii) the interpretational ambiguity of natural direct and indirect effect estimates. We use potential outcomes notation and directed acyclic graphs to explain 'cross-world' assumptions, illustrate implications of this assumption via regression models and discuss ensuing issues of interpretation. We argue that the debate on the relevance of natural direct and indirect effects rests on whether one takes as a target of inference the mathematical object per se, or the change in the world that the mathematical object represents. We further note that public health questions may be better served by estimating controlled direct effects.},

Design                Systematic review of studies that reported the effect of clean cookstove use on BP among women, and implementation science outcomes in LMICs.                                            Data sources                We searched PubMed, Embase, INSPEC, Scielo, Cochrane Library, Global Health and Web of Science PLUS. We conducted searches in November 2017 with a repeat in May 2018. We did not restrict article publication date.                                            Eligibility criteria for selecting studies                We included only studies conducted in LMICs, published in English, regardless of publication year and studies that examined the use of improved or clean cookstove intervention on BP. Two authors independently screened journal article titles, abstracts and full-text articles to identify those that included the following search terms: high BP, hypertension and or household air pollution, LMICs, cookstove and implementation outcomes.                                            Results                Of the 461 non-duplicate articles identified, three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (in Nigeria, Guatemala and Ghana) and two studies of pre--post design (in Bolivia and Nicaragua) met eligibility criteria. These articles evaluated the effect of cookstove use on BP in women. Two of the three RCTs reported a mean reduction in diastolic BP of -2.8\,mm Hg (-5.0, --0.6; p=0.01) for the Nigerian study; -3.0\,mm Hg; (-5.7, --0.4; p=0.02) for the Guatemalan study; while the study conducted in Ghana reported a non-significant change in BP. The pre--post studies reported a significant reduction in mean systolic BP of -5.5\,mm Hg; (p=0.01) for the Bolivian study, and -5.9\,mm Hg (-11.3, --0.4; p=0.05) for the Nicaraguan study. Implementation science outcomes were reported in all five studies (three reported feasibility, one reported adoption and one reported feasibility and adoption of cookstove interventions).                                            Conclusion                Although this review demonstrated that there is limited evidence on the implementation of clean cookstove use in LMICs, the effects of clean cookstove on BP were significant for both systolic and diastolic BP among women. Future studies should consider standardised reporting of implementation outcomes.},

  abstract = {Approximately 3 billion people, most of whom live in Asia, Africa, and the Americas, rely on solid fuels (i.e. wood, crop wastes, dung, charcoal) and kerosene for their cooking needs. Exposure to household air pollution from burning these fuels is estimated to account for approximately 3 million premature deaths a year. Cleaner fuels -- such as liquefied petroleum gas, biogas, electricity, and certain compressed biomass fuels -- have the potential to alleviate much of this significant health burden. A wide variety of clean cooking intervention programs are being implemented around the world, but very few of these efforts have been analyzed to enable global learning. The Clean Cooking Implementation Science Network (ISN), supported by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) and partners, identified the need to augment the publicly available literature concerning what has worked well and in what context. The ISN has supported the development of a systematic set of case studies, contained in this Special Issue, examining clean cooking program rollouts in a variety of low- and middle-income settings around the world. We used the RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adaptation, implementation, maintenance) framework to coordinate and evaluate the case studies. This paper describes the clean cooking case studies project, introduces the individual studies contained herein, and proposes a general conceptual model to support future planning and evaluation of household energy programs.},

Good health and well-being; 5. Gender equality; 7. Affordable and clean energy; 13. Climate action; 15. Life on land. Programs are being implemented around the world to introduce alternative cooking technologies, and we are well on the way to achieving the goal set by the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves to reach 100 million homes with cleaner and more efficient cooking methods by 2020. Despite evidence that household air pollution (HAP) from solid fuel combustion is responsible for 3-4 million early deaths per year, many cookstove programs are motivated and/or financed by climate change mitigation schemes and deploy alternative stoves that use solid fuels such as wood and charcoal. However, recent studies have demonstrated that improved biomass-burning stoves typically only incrementally improve air quality and yield modest or minimal health benefits. Likewise, their contributions to climate change mitigation and other SDGs may be limited. Evidence indicates that cleaner fuels, such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), ethanol and biogas, offer greater potential benefits not only to health, but also greater progress towards climate goals and other relevant SDGs. We present a modeled estimate of these potential gains for a diverse group of 40 LMICs. Our model suggests that cookstove programs using LPG stoves and fuel will yield greater reductions in both Disability Adjusted Life Years and Global Warming Commitment in these countries than those using improved biomass stoves. Cost and infrastructure requirements for clean fuels such as LPG are widely recognized constraints. In view of these constraints we present an analytical method to simultaneously consider health and climate needs at the national level for the same 40 countries in the context of estimated LPG expansion potentials. Comparative analyses integrating priorities across SDGs at the national and regional levels may guide more practical and effective household energy development choices going forward.},

The Randomized Exposure Study of Pollution Indoors and Respiratory Effects (RESPIRE) is a randomized intervention trial evaluating the respiratory health effects of reducing indoor air pollution from open cooking fires. A total of 504 rural Mayan women in highland Guatemala aged 15--50 years, all using traditional indoor open fires, were randomized to either receive a chimney woodstove (plancha) or continue using the open fire. Assessments of chronic respiratory symptoms and lung function and individual measurements of carbon monoxide exposure were performed at baseline and every 6 months up to 18 months. Use of a plancha significantly reduced carbon monoxide exposure by 61.6\%. For all respiratory symptoms, reductions in risk were observed in the plancha group during follow-up; the reduction was statistically significant for wheeze (relative risk\,=\,0.42, 95\% confidence interval: 0.25, 0.70). The number of respiratory symptoms reported by the women at each follow-up point was also significantly reduced by the plancha (odds ratio\,=\,0.7, 95\% confidence interval: 0.50, 0.97). However, no significant effects on lung function were found after 12--18 months. Reducing indoor air pollution from household biomass burning may relieve symptoms consistent with chronic respiratory tract irritation.},

Outdoor temperature was estimated from regional meteorological stations. We used multivariable mixed-effects regression models to estimate the within-individual and between-individual effects of indoor and outdoor temperatures on BP.         Results:~         Indoor and outdoor temperatures ranged from 0.0 to 28 {$^\circ$}C and -14.3 to 6.4 {$^\circ$}C, respectively. In adjusted models, a 1 {$^\circ$}C increase in indoor temperature was associated with decreased SBP [-0.4 mmHg, 95\% confidence interval (CI): -0.7 to -0.1 (between-individual; brachial and central BP); -0.5 mmHg, 95\% CI: -0.8 to -0.2 (within-individual, brachial BP); -0.4 mmHg, 95\% CI: -0.7 to -0.2 (within-individual, central BP)], DBP [-0.2 mmHg, 95\% CI:-0.4 to -0.03 (between-individual); -0.3 mmHg, 95\% CI: -0.5 to -0.04 (within-individual)], and within-individual pulse pressure [-0.2 mmHg, 95\% CI: -0.4 to -0.04 (central); -0.3 mmHg, 95\% CI: -0.4 to -0.1 (brachial)]. Between-individual SBP estimates were larger among participants with hypertension. There was no evidence of an effect of outdoor temperature on BP.         Conclusion:~         Our results support previous findings of inverse associations between indoor temperature and BP but contrast with prior evidence of an inverse relationship with outdoor temperature. Wintertime home heating may be a population-wide intervention strategy for high BP and cardiovascular disease in China.},

  author = {VanderWeele, Tyler J},
  year = {2015},
  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  address = {New York},
  abstract = {"The book provides an accessible but comprehensive overview of methods for mediation and interaction. There has been considerable and rapid methodological development on mediation and moderation/interaction analysis within the causal-inference literature over the last ten years. Much of this material appears in a variety of specialized journals, and some of the papers are quite technical. There has also been considerable interest in these developments from empirical researchers in the social and biomedical sciences. However, much of the material is not currently in a format that is accessible to them. The book closes these gaps by providing an accessible, comprehensive, book-length coverage of mediation. The book begins with a comprehensive introduction to mediation analysis, including chapters on concepts for mediation, regression-based methods, sensitivity analysis, time-to-event outcomes, methods for multiple mediators, methods for time-varying mediation and longitudinal data, and relations between mediation and other concepts involving intermediates such as surrogates, principal stratification, instrumental variables, and Mendelian randomization. The second part of the book concerns interaction or "moderation," including concepts for interaction, statistical interaction, confounding and interaction, mechanistic interaction, bias analysis for interaction, interaction in genetic studies, and power and sample-size calculation for interaction. The final part of the book provides comprehensive discussion about the relationships between mediation and interaction and unites these concepts within a single framework. This final part also provides an introduction to spillover effects or social interaction, concluding with a discussion of social-network analyses. The book is written to be accessible to anyone with a basic knowledge of statistics. Comprehensive appendices provide more technical details for the interested reader. Applied empirical examples from a variety of fields are given throughout. Software implementation in SAS, Stata, SPSS, and R is provided. The book should be accessible to students and researchers who have completed a first-year graduate sequence in quantitative methods in one of the social- or biomedical-sciences disciplines. The book will only presuppose familiarity with linear and logistic regression, and could potentially be used as an advanced undergraduate book as well"--},

Historically, wearable aerosol monitors have proven to be expensive, noisy, and burdensome. The objective of this work was to develop a new type of wearable monitor, an ultrasonic personal aerosol sampler (UPAS), to overcome many of the technological limitations in personal exposure assessment. The UPAS is a time-integrated monitor that features a novel micropump that is virtually silent during operation. A suite of onboard environmental sensors integrated with this pump measure and record mass airflow (0.5-3.0 L/min, accurate within 5\%), temperature, pressure, relative humidity, light intensity, and acceleration. Rapid development of the UPAS was made possible through recent advances in low-cost electronics, open-source programming platforms, and additive manufacturing for rapid prototyping. Interchangeable cyclone inlets provided a close match to the EPA PM2.5 mass criterion (within 5\%) for device flows at either 1.0 or 2.0 L/min. Battery life varied from 23 to 45 hours depending on sample flow rate and selected filter media. Laboratory tests of the UPAS prototype demonstrate excellent agreement with equivalent federal reference method samplers for gravimetric analysis of PM2.5 across a broad range of concentrations.},

This equivalence furthers our understanding of the anatomy of TWFE, and has several applications. The equivalence between TWFE and TWM implies that various estimators used for intervention analysis -- with a common entry time into treatment or staggered entry, with or without covariates -- can be computed using TWFE or pooled OLS regressions that control for time-constant treatment intensities, covariates, and interactions between them. The approach allows considerable heterogeneity in treatment effects across treatment intensity, calendar time, and covariates. The equivalence implies that standard strategies for heterogeneous trends are available to relax the common trends assumption. Further, the two-way Mundlak regression is easily adapted to nonlinear models such as exponential models and logit and probit models.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               A variety of public health interventions have been undertaken in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) to prevent morbidity and mortality associated with household air pollution (HAP) due to cooking, heating and lighting with solid biomass fuels. Pregnant women and children under five are particularly vulnerable to the effects of HAP, due to biological susceptibility and typically higher exposure levels. However, the relative health benefits of interventions to reduce HAP exposure among these groups remain unclear. This systematic review aims to assess, among pregnant women, infants and children (under 5 years) in LMIC settings, the effectiveness of interventions which aim to reduce household air pollutant emissions due to household solid biomass fuel combustion, compared to usual cooking practices, in terms of health outcomes associated with HAP exposure.                                         Methods                                This protocol follows standard systematic review processes and abides by the PRISMA-P reporting guidelines. Searches will be undertaken in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), The Global Index Medicus (GIM),                 ClinicalTrials.gov                 and Greenfile, combining terms for pregnant women and children with interventions or policy approaches to reduce HAP from biomass fuels or HAP terms and LMIC countries. Included studies will be those reporting (i) pregnant women and children under 5 years; (ii) fuel transition, structural, educational or policy interventions; and (iii) health events associated with HAP exposure which occur among pregnant women or among children within the perinatal period, infancy and up to 5 years of age. A narrative synthesis will be undertaken for each population-intervention-outcome triad stratified by study design. Clinical and methodological homogeneity within each triad will be used to determine the feasibility for undertaking meta-analyses to give a summary estimate of the effect for each outcome.                                                        Discussion               This systematic review will identify the effectiveness of existing HAP intervention measures in LMIC contexts, with discussion on the context of implementation and adoption, and summarise current literature of relevance to maternal and child health. This assessment reflects the need for HAP interventions which achieve measurable health benefits, which would need to be supported by policies that are socially and economically acceptable in LMIC settings worldwide.

Using general linear mixed models and generalized estimating equation models, we compared levels of particulate matter and of hospital admissions (age groups\,=\,45--64 and {$\geq$}\,65 years) in the SJVAB for cardiovascular disease (CVD), ischemic heart disease (IHD), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease during the burn seasons before (2000--2003) and after (2003--2006) implementation.              Results. After implementation, we observed reductions of 12\%, 11\%, and 15\% in particulate matter\, 2.5 micrometers in diameter or smaller (PM2.5), and 8\%, 7\%, and 11\% in coarse particles, in the entire SJVAB and in rural and urban regions of the air basin, respectively. Among those aged 65 years and older, Rule 4901 was estimated to prevent 7\%, 8\%, and 5\% of CVD cases, and 16\%, 17\%, and 13\% of IHD cases, in the entire SJVAB and in rural and urban regions, respectively.              Conclusions. The study suggests that Rule 4901 is effective at reducing wintertime ambient PM2.5 levels and decreasing hospital admissions for heart disease among people aged 65 years and older.},

  abstract = {Background:               Approximately 3 to 4 billion people worldwide are exposed to household air pollution, which has been associated with increased blood pressure (BP) in pregnant women in some studies.                                         Methods:                                We recruited 3195 pregnant women in Guatemala, India, Peru, and Rwanda and randomly assigned them to intervention or control groups. The intervention group received a gas stove and fuel during pregnancy, while the controls continued cooking with solid fuels. We measured BP and personal exposure to PM                 2.5                 , black carbon and carbon monoxide 3{\texttimes} during gestation. We conducted an intention-to-treat and exposure-response analysis to determine if household air pollution exposure was associated with increased gestational BP.                                                        Results:                                Median 24-hour PM                 2.5                 dropped from 84 to 24 {$\mu$}g/m                 3                 after the intervention; black carbon and carbon monoxide decreased similarly. Intention-to-treat analyses showed an increase in systolic BP and diastolic BP in both arms during gestation, as expected, but the increase was greater in intervention group for both systolic BP (0.69 mm\,Hg [0.03--1.35];                 P                 =0.04) and diastolic BP (0.62 mm\,Hg [0.05--1.19];                 P                 =0.03). The exposure-response analyses suggested that higher exposures to household air pollution were associated with moderately higher systolic BP and diastolic BP; however, none of these associations reached conventional statistical significance.                                                        Conclusions:               In intention-to-treat, we found higher gestational BP in the intervention group compared with controls, contrary to expected. In exposure-response analyses, we found a slight increase in BP with higher exposure, but it was not statistically significant. Overall, an intervention with gas stoves did not markedly affect gestational BP.},

  abstract = {Residential contributions are substantially magnified from energy use, emissions, air pollution, to health impacts.           ,                             Residential contribution to air pollution--associated health impacts is critical, but inadequately addressed because of data gaps. Here, we fully model the effects of residential energy use on emissions, outdoor and indoor PM               2.5               concentrations, exposure, and premature deaths using updated energy data. We show that the residential sector contributed only 7.5\% of total energy consumption but contributed 27\% of primary PM               2.5               emissions; 23 and 71\% of the outdoor and indoor PM               2.5               concentrations, respectively; 68\% of PM               2.5               exposure; and 67\% of PM               2.5               -induced premature deaths in 2014 in China, with a progressive order of magnitude increase from sources to receptors. Biomass fuels and coal provided similar contributions to health impacts. These findings are particularly true for rural populations, which contribute more to emissions and face higher premature death risks than urban populations. The impacts of both residential and nonresidential emissions are interconnected, and efforts are necessary to simultaneously mitigate both emission types.},
