## Specific Aims and Overarching Approach

This study builds on three data collection campaigns in winter 2018/19, winter 2019/20, and winter 2021/22, as well as a partial campaign in winter 2020/21 (CIHR-funded) with the following specific aims:

1. 	Estimate how much of the policyâ€™s overall effect on health, including respiratory symptoms and cardiovascular outcomes (blood pressure, central hemodynamics, blood inflammatory and oxidative stress markers), can be attributed to its impact on changes in PM2.5;

2. 	Quantify the contribution of changes in the chemical composition of PM2.5 from different sources to the overall effect on health outcomes;

3. 	Quantify the impact of the policy on outdoor air quality and personal air pollution exposures, and specifically the source contribution from household coal burning.
