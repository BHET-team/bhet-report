Brief summary of what we did.

\hypertarget{introduction}{%
\subsection{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

China is deploying an ambitious plan to transition up to 70\% of all
households in northern China to clean space heating, including Beijing.
To meet this target the Beijing municipal government announced a
two-pronged program that designates coal-restricted areas and
simultaneously offers subsidies to night-time electricity rates and for
the purchase and installation of electric-powered, air-source heat pumps
to replace traditional coal-heating stoves. The program is being rolled
out on a village-by-village basis; however there is uncertainty as to
when villages will receive the program. The variability in when the
policy is applied to each village allows us to treat the roll-out of the
program as a quasi-randomized intervention. Households may also be
differentially affected by this program due to factors such as financial
constraints, preferences and social capital, and there is uncertainty
about whether and how this intervention may affect indoor and outdoor
air pollution, as well as health behaviors and health outcomes.

\subsection{Specific Aims and Overarching
Approach}\label{specific-aims-and-overarching-approach}}

This study builds on three data collection campaigns in winter 2018/19,
winter 2019/20, and winter 2021/22, as well as a partial campaign in
winter 2020/21 (CIHR-funded) with the following specific aims:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Estimate how much of the policy's overall effect on health, including
  respiratory symptoms and cardiovascular outcomes (blood pressure,
  central hemodynamics, blood inflammatory and oxidative stress
  markers), can be attributed to its impact on changes in PM2.5;
\item
  Quantify the impact of the policy on outdoor air quality and personal
  air pollution exposures, and specifically the source contribution from
  household coal burning (Previously Aim 3);
\item
  Quantify the contribution of changes in the chemical composition of
  PM2.5 from different sources to the overall effect on health outcomes
  (Previously Aim 2).
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}

\end{itemize}

To understand how Beijing's policy works we used a
difference-in-differences (DiD) design (Callaway 2020), leveraging the
staggered rollout of the policy across multiple villages to estimate its
impact on health outcomes and understand the mechanisms through which it
works.

\includegraphics{hei-report_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-1-1.pdf}

The DiD design compares outcomes before and after an intervention in a
treated group relative to the same outcomes measured in a control group.
The control group trend provides the crucial ``counterfactual'' estimate
of what would have happened in the treated group had it not been
treated. By comparing each group to itself, this approach helps to
control for both measured and unmeasured fixed differences between the
treated and control groups. By measuring changes over time in outcomes
in the control group unaffected by the treatment, this approach also
controls for any unmeasured factors affecting outcome trends in both
treated and control groups. This is important since there are often many
potential factors affecting outcome trends that cannot be disentangled
from the policy if one only studies the treated group (as in a
traditional pre-post design).

The canonical DiD design (Card and Krueger 1994) compares two groups
(treated and control) at two different time periods (pre- and
post-intervention, Figure X). In the first time period both groups are
untreated, and in the second time period one group is exposed to the
intervention. If we assume that the differences between the groups would
have remained constant in the absence of the intervention (parallel
trends assumption), then an unbiased estimate of the impact of the
intervention in the post period can be calculated by subtracting the
pre-post difference in the untreated group from the pre-post difference
in the treated group.

However, when multiple groups are treated at different time periods, the
most common approach has been to use a two-way fixed effects model to
estimate the impact of the intervention which controls for secular
trends and differences between districts. However, recent evidence
suggests that the traditional two-way fixed effects estimation of the
treatment effect may be biased in the context of heterogeneous treatment
effects (Callaway and Sant'Anna 2021; Goodman-Bacon 2021)

\hypertarget{data-analysis}{%
\subsection{Data Analysis}\label{data-analysis}}

\hypertarget{total-effect}{%
\subsubsection{Total Effect}\label{total-effect}}

To estimate the total effect of the policy we used a DiD analysis that
accommodates staggered

\hypertarget{mediation-analysis}{%
\subsubsection{Mediation Analysis}\label{mediation-analysis}}

To describe the causal mediation analysis we can represent the total
effect with the following equation, noting that we simplify the DiD
equation above by dropping the error terms and using \(X\) as a generic
term to capture the village fixed effects (\(V_{j}\)), time fixed
effects (\(P{j}\)) and other covariates (\(Z_{jt}\) and \(X_{ijt}\))
that, as noted above, we assume are sufficient to estimate the total
effect:

\[E[Y|T,X]=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}T +\beta_{2}X\]

where \(\beta_{1}\) represents the impact of the intervention \(T\) and
\(X\) represents a vector of pre-treatment covariates sufficient to
estimate the total effect without bias. After estimating the total
effect, we will estimate the controlled direct effect (\(CDE\)), which
gives the effect of the intervention on outcomes through pathways other
than the proposed mediator (i.e., the ``direct'' path \(T\rightarrow Y\)
in the DAG (Figure ?) above), after setting the mediator to a specific
value. The \(CDE\) can be derived after estimating the following
equation:

\[E[Y|T,X,M] = \gamma_{0} + \gamma_{1}T + \gamma_{2}M + \gamma_{3}TM + \gamma_{4}X + \gamma_{5}W\]

Noting that \(\gamma_{3}\) allows for interaction between the exposure
and mediator, the \(CDE\) is estimated as: \(\gamma_{1}+\gamma_{3}MT\).
In the absence of interaction between the exposure and the mediator
(i.e., \(\gamma_{3}=0\)) the \(CDE\) will simply be \(\gamma_{1}\),
i.e., the effect of the policy holding \(M\) constant. For a valid
estimate of the \(CDE\) we must account for confounding of the
mediator-outcome effect, represented by \(W\) in the equation above. In
our example this might include changes in cooking behavior, diet or
tobacco smoking, or indoor temperature. Baseline measures of both the
outcome and the proposed mediators will help to reduce the potential for
unmeasured confounding of the mediator-outcome effect (Keele et al.
2015). In addition to estimating the \(CDE\), we may also be interested
in measures of how much of the of the policy's impact may be due to its
impact on the mediator. One potential way of estimating this is to
subtract the \(CDE\) from the \(TE\) and express this as a proportion
(sometimes called the ``proportion eliminated''), i.e.,
\(PE = [TE - CDE(m)] / TE\) or, using the two equations above,
\((\beta_{1} - \gamma_{1}) / \beta_{1}\). In our example this
corresponds to the proportion of the total effect of the CBHP policy on
blood pressure that could be eliminated if we were to fix
PM\textsubscript{2.5} at a certain value \(M=m\).
